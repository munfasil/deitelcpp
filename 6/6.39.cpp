   * there are two parts in the series lets take an exampe from  recursive outcome.
   * 1 -> 3
   * 1 -> 2
   * 3 -> 2
   * 1 -> 3
   * 2 -> 1
   * 2 -> 3
   * 1 -> 3
   *
   * So there are two series. The first series can be deduced using formulae.
   * 1 1 3 1 2 2 1
   * where n =  {1..7}
   * n & (n-1) % 3 (bounded by 3 poles)
   * similarly the second series can deduced.
   * (n | (n -1) + 1) % 3 (bounded by 3 poles)
   *
   * These are mathematical models for patterns something similar to fibancci series 1 1 2 3 5
   * n + (n-1)
